# Sprint Review and Retrospective - CS 250 Final Project

## Overview

This repository contains the **Sprint Review and Retrospective** deliverable from the CS 250 Final Project. This document encapsulates the Agile and Scrum practices applied throughout the course and reflects on the work completed during the development process.

## Artifact Description

The Sprint Review and Retrospective document provides a comprehensive summary of the project's progress, highlights the contributions of various Scrum roles, and evaluates the effectiveness of Agile methodologies. It demonstrates how the project team responded to challenges, managed changes, and delivered a successful product increment.

## Essential Questions Reflection

### 1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Understanding user needs is a fundamental aspect of software development. User stories are a critical tool in this process as they break down user requirements into actionable tasks for the development team. By focusing on the "who," "what," and "why" of a feature, user stories help ensure that the development aligns closely with user expectations. This process enables developers to prioritize tasks, iterate on functionality, and continuously refine the product to meet user needs effectively.

### 2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

My approach to developing programs is rooted in Agile principles, which emphasize flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development. I plan to incorporate processes such as **sprint planning**, **daily stand-ups**, and **continuous integration** into my future work. These practices ensure that the development process is adaptive to changes and focused on delivering incremental value. Agile's emphasis on regular feedback and collaboration with stakeholders will guide my approach to ensuring that projects stay on track and meet the intended goals.

### 3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development involves active communication, collaboration, and a willingness to support the team in overcoming challenges. It means contributing constructively during sprint meetings, being open to feedback, and helping to resolve blockers that may impede the team's progress. A good team member is also proactive in sharing knowledge and assisting others, fostering a positive and productive team environment.
